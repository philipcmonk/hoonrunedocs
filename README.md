hoonrunedocs
============

A series of scripts for gleaning information about the hoon runes.

To use, just run runegen.py in its directory.  This will create a series of files in the runes/ directory with information about all known hoon runes.  Note that runegen.py depends on hoon.hoon and runelist.  You should be able to update hoon.hoon without issue, but if the format is changed significantly, then the script may require some tweaking.
